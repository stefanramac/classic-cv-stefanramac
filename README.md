## üöÄ Deployment to cPanel

### Quick Deployment

Use the provided script to create a clean deployment package:
```bash
./create-deployment.sh
```

This creates `deployment.zip` with only necessary files:
- `index.html`
- `404.html`
- `styles.css`
- `script.js`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Antivirus False Positive

If cPanel shows a virus warning like "Sanesecurity.Foxhole.JS_Zip_11.UNOFFICIAL", this is a **false positive**. The scanner is flagging the jsPDF library or JavaScript patterns.

**Solutions:**
1. **Upload files individually** - Use cPanel File Manager to upload each file separately
2. **Use FTP** - FTP uploads often bypass the antivirus scanner (use FileZilla)
3. **Contact hosting support** - Ask them to whitelist your upload
4. **Try deployment.zip** - Already created without problematic files

### Alternative: Manual Upload

1. Go to cPanel File Manager
2. Navigate to `public_html`
3. Upload these files one by one:
   - `index.html`
   - `404.html` 
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
4. Set proper permissions (644 for files)

**Note:** The site works as a static website. You don't need Node.js/Express on cPanel unless you want to use the API routes. The CV download feature works client-side without server dependencies.
